🏁 Labyrinth Graph Solver
🔍 LabyrinthGraphSolver is a Python application that transforms a text-based maze into a graph representation and applies BFS/DFS algorithms to find all possible paths to exits.

📌 Features
✅ Graph-based maze representation – Converts a text labyrinth into an adjacency list.
✅ Pathfinding Algorithms – Uses BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search).
✅ Graphical Visualization – Displays the maze and dynamically highlights found paths.
✅ Exit Accessibility Detection – Identifies unreachable exits from the starting point.
✅ Interactive Exploration – Users can select the start node and visualize paths dynamically.

🛠️ Technologies Used
1. Python – Core programming language
2. Tkinter – GUI for visualization
3. Graph Algorithms (BFS/DFS) – For pathfinding
4. File Processing – Reads maze structure from a text file
